What is Table-Util?
===================

A set of JS tools (based on Mootools) to add features (such as filters) to the HTML table element.

How to use it?
==============

Have a look to the demo provided on this repo to know how to use table-util.

For now, two constructors are exposed by the TU module:
    - TU.TableFilter: make you able to filter tables rows;
    - TU.TablePager: make you able to add pagination on your tables.

Documentation
=============

Coming (not really) soon.
